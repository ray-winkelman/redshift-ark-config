#### Ark-In-A-Box Notice (For Server Admins)
A RedShift server instance is deployable by cloning this repository and running `*_Update.bat` followed by `*_Run.bat` with `*` depending on the map of choice. If you replicate the RedShift configuration: *Be sure to give credit where it's due!* 
> Side Note: Don't forget to copy the config files in `/GlobalConfig` to the `/ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer` folder downloaded by the `*_Update.bat` script.


## Important Notice
The server goes offline between 2 and 20 minutes to run automated updates and backups everyday at 6:00am (AST). Please be cognisant of the fact that you may be booted, but **will not loose your current game progress**.


## Introduction
The RedShift Ark server rotates and hosts survivors on official maps using the configuration files in this repository.
